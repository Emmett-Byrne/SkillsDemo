# SkillsDemo

######Description

So since I'm starting my job hunt in the big bad world of software I decided to make this skills demo, 
where I'll continue to build and add Projects to show off my skills old and new. I'm going to try keep this
well documented with each project having a brief overview and going into more detail as you explore the project.

##Current Prejects
1. Route Builder (C++, Graph data structure and pathfinding algorithm)
2. (In Progress) Behaviour (C#, Unity, Behavioural algorithm, 3D modelling and animation(Maybe))


##Project Descriptions

#Route Builder
This is a quick project I did over a weekend. I created a list of European Capitals along with their coordinates and created connections between the various cities.
I then created a pathfinding algorithm (A*) that when given 2 locations will navigate through the graph and efficiently find the shortest route.
The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate c++ and coding fundamentals, (encapsulation, containers, pointers etc.)
